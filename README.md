# flutter_test_tutorial


This is a Flutter unit test tutorial written in Dart, using flutter_test package for unit testing a Flutter application. 

It tests a GreetingController class which is imported and creates an instance of it. The test file defines a group of test cases, each test case calls a method on the greetingController instance and compares the return value with the expected greeting using the expect() function. 

The goal of this test is to check if the greeting() method of GreetingController class returns the expected greeting based on the hour passed to it.
